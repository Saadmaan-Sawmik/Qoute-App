# Qoute-App
A Simple Django App

I am working on a larger site, and it is taking so long, so I’ve decided to upload a simpler one to cover the gap.
This simple quote list view app is made using django 2.2. I thought this app worth sharing because I love the fact that it has
so nice and simple code base. And mostly because I implemented a full functioning paginator template.

Anyone can copy the paginator template from here and simply just include it into their project. I hope it will fit in well.

Again, this may not be the ultimate solution to colonize the mars, or something like that, but it does what it does.
